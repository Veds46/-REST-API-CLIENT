Task 2 of my Java internship at CodTech involves developing a Java application that consumes a public REST API and displays the retrieved data in a structured format. This task is essential for understanding how Java interacts with web services, a crucial skill in modern software development. REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) enable applications to communicate over the internet, allowing them to fetch and process real-time data.
To complete this task, I will first select a public REST API that provides meaningful data, such as weather information, cryptocurrency prices, or news updates. For example, using an API like OpenWeatherMap can help fetch weather details based on user input, making the application interactive and practical. The API endpoint and request format will be analyzed to ensure proper data retrieval.
The next step is to send HTTP requests to the API and handle the responses. Java provides the HttpURLConnection and HttpClient classes to make HTTP GET requests, which retrieve data from the API. I will structure the request to ensure it adheres to the API’s requirements, such as including authentication tokens or query parameters.
Once the data is fetched, the response is usually in JSON format. Parsing this JSON data is a crucial part of the task, as it converts raw API responses into meaningful information. Java offers libraries like org.json, Gson, and Jackson to process JSON efficiently. Using these libraries, I will extract relevant fields from the response and structure them in a readable format.
Displaying the retrieved data in an organized manner is another key aspect. I will use Java’s built-in console output for basic formatting or a graphical user interface (GUI) with JavaFX or Swing for an enhanced user experience. A well-structured display improves readability and usability, making the application more user-friendly.
Error handling is a critical component of API-based applications. Issues such as invalid API requests, network failures, or incorrect JSON formatting can lead to application crashes. To prevent this, I will implement exception handling using try-catch blocks, ensuring that meaningful error messages are displayed to users.
Proper documentation and code commenting are essential for maintainability. I will include detailed comments explaining each function and API call, making the code easier to understand for future reference. Additionally, I will store my project in a GitHub repository for version control, enabling easy tracking of updates and collaboration if needed.
To complete this task successfully, I will utilize online resources like Google, YouTube tutorials, and ChatGPT for troubleshooting and optimization. Following the video guidance provided on WhatsApp and staying updated with group notifications will also help in aligning my work with internship requirements.
